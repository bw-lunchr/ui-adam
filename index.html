        <h1>What is Luncher?</h1>
        <h3>Every child deserves a healthy, nutritious lunch.</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, not every child is able to pay for their own lunch.  At Luncher, we help school districts that have a shortfall in their lunch budgets to locate willing donors.  This allows the school to shrink or eliminate the shortfall so that they can allow their students to focus on learning, rather than spend the day hungry.</p>
        <p>For donors, Luncher locates school districts in their area that are in need of additional funding.  This assures donors that their funds are making a significant local impact.</p>
